# Evaluation Plan - ArXiv RAG Pipeline

**Project:** CS6300 Assignment 5 - ArXiv RAG Pipeline  
**Date:** October 2024  
**Framework:** Unified Test Runner with Multiple Scenarios

## Test Strategy

The evaluation plan uses a unified test runner with multiple scenarios to validate both individual tool performance and integrated RAG pipeline behavior. Tests are designed to validate the two-flow architecture: population pipeline and conversation pipeline.

## Test Framework

- **Unified Test Runner**: `scripts/test_runner.py` with extensible scenario support
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Poignant prompts, conversation flow, and smart person simulation
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Success rates, response times, context retrieval accuracy
- **Error Handling**: Context overflow management and graceful degradation

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Poignant Prompts Test
**Purpose**: Test focused, direct questions on complex topics
- **Queries**: 10 targeted questions about algorithms, results, datasets, limitations
- **Success Criteria**: >80% query success rate, relevant context retrieval
- **Command**: `python3 scripts/test_runner.py --scenario poignant --topic "neural networks" --max-papers 12`
- **Expected Output**: Detailed responses with paper citations and technical depth

### 2. Conversation Test
**Purpose**: Test conversational flow that builds understanding
- **Queries**: 8 follow-up questions that build on previous responses
- **Success Criteria**: Conversation coherence, context accumulation, history management
- **Command**: `python3 scripts/test_runner.py --scenario conversation --topic "neural networks" --max-papers 12`
- **Expected Output**: Natural conversation flow with maintained context

### 3. Smart Person Test
**Purpose**: Test meeting preparation with technical jargon
- **Queries**: 8 questions about buzzwords, methodologies, performance metrics
- **Success Criteria**: Technical terminology usage, impressive metrics citation
- **Command**: `python3 scripts/test_runner.py --scenario smart-person --topic "deep learning" --max-papers 12`
- **Expected Output**: Meeting-ready responses with technical depth

## Success Metrics

- **Query Success Rate**: >80% for all scenarios
- **Response Time**: <20 seconds per query on average
- **Context Retrieval**: Top-5 relevant papers retrieved per query
- **Conversation Coherence**: Natural flow across multiple turns
- **Cache Utilization**: Efficient context caching and reuse
- **Context Management**: 100% recovery from overflow errors

## Performance Metrics

- **Pipeline Completion**: End-to-end success for both population and conversation flows
- **Tool Success**: Individual tools meet their specific success criteria
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with intelligent context truncation
- **Output Quality**: Contextual responses with paper citations and source links

## Validation Protocol

The system includes comprehensive test reporting that:
- Runs all three scenarios with detailed metrics
- Validates tool execution and context retrieval
- Checks for proper JSON structure and conversation flow
- Verifies chat history persistence and session management
- Provides detailed success/failure reporting with performance analysis

## Expected Behaviors

- All scenarios complete within 3 minutes total
- Success rate >80% for valid research queries
- Graceful degradation when individual tools fail
- Consistent response format with source citations
- Intelligent context management preventing overflow errors
